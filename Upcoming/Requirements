1 User Authentication: Like SSH, the protocol will likely require some form of user authentication to ensure that only authorized users can access the system. You will need to consider how users will authenticate themselves, such as with a username and password, public key authentication, or some other method.

2 Encryption: You will need to ensure that the protocol encrypts data in transit to protect it from interception or tampering. You may also need to consider how to protect against other attacks, such as replay attacks.

3 User Interface Design: As you are creating a user interface for the protocol, you will need to consider how users will interact with the system. This includes designing a user-friendly interface that is easy to navigate, provides helpful feedback, and meets the needs of the target audience.

4 Support for Multiple Operating Systems: To be widely adopted, the protocol should be compatible with a range of operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and Linux. You will need to consider how to ensure compatibility across these systems and any limitations that may exist.

5 Security and Maintenance: Like any software application, the protocol will require ongoing maintenance to address security vulnerabilities and keep it up to date with the latest technologies. You will need to consider how to ensure the security of the protocol, how to handle updates and maintenance, and how to respond to any security incidents that may occur.
